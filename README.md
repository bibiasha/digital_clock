#React Digital Clock App
This is a simple React application that displays the current time on the screen, which is updated every second.

Usage
To use this code in a React application:

Clone this repository or copy the code into your own React project.

In the command line, navigate to the project directory and install any necessary dependencies using npm install.

Import the App component into your React application and add it to your JSX code.

Run your React application using npm start and open it in your browser.

The clock should appear on the screen and update every second with the current time.

How it works
This code imports a CSS file and the useState hook from the React library. It defines a function component App() that returns a single HTML element, a div containing an h1 element with the current time as its text content.

The useState hook is used to initialize the currentTime state variable with an initial value of undefined. The updateTime() function is defined to set the value of currentTime to the current time string using toLocaleTimeString() method of the Date object. The setInterval() method is then used to call updateTime() every 1000 milliseconds, which updates the currentTime state variable and causes the component to re-render with the updated time on the screen.
